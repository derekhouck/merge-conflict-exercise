# A story in need of elaboration

There once was a young individual who wanted to learn coding. They had heard
about the legendary monster `git` and were terrified of incurring its wrath. To
combat this ancient evil, they _resolved this merge conflict by including both
their daring manuever and this copy: and finished it off by typing in
`git merge main`._ And after that, all was right in the world and in their
codebase. The end.
